Lab 1 Testing Description:

The testing of this lab was fairly minimal. It consited of writing the outputs of the /proc/lab1 file using varios commands (dd,more & cat) to out files lab1.out1, lab1.out2 & lab1.out3.
The difference of these outputs can be seen in the Name field as it extracts the command used to call the module and the PID number.

note that the files were written using the redirect command as such: cat /proc/lab1 > lab1.out1

The module was also run as root by logging in as root using the sudo su - command and then running the same cat command:
cat /proc/lab1 > lab1.outroot1
note that as root the UID's and GID's were set to zero.
